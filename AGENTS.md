## Shared engineering guidance

- **STD-HIERARCHY-001** — Shared rules apply to every project; service rules additionally apply to service projects, and project-specific authoritative documents may only add or tighten constraints.
- **STD-DOCS-001** — Before changing a service, read the project documentation entry declared by its project guidance, then read every authoritative document routed for the task.
- **STD-DOMAIN-002** — Before changing domain boundaries, language, business rules, errors, domain events, or API business semantics, read the service's authoritative domain document.
- **JAVA-VERSION-001** — Use Java 17.
- **DEP-CYCLE-001** — Module dependency cycles are forbidden; fix responsibilities or extract a shared module rather than hiding a cycle through reflection or events.
- **ARCH-DIRECTION-001** — Inner modules must not depend on outer protocols, persistence implementations, persistence objects, or the boot module.
- **ARCH-RESPONSIBILITY-001** — Keep domain rules in domain, use-case orchestration in application, technical adapters in infrastructure, protocol handling in interfaces, and runtime assembly in boot.
- **ERROR-STABILITY-001** — Never modify, reuse, or reassign a published error code.
- **VERIFY-CHANGE-001** — Run verification proportional to the change and do not claim completion without reporting the commands and results.

## Skill routing

- Developing, changing, or reviewing service code under the shared engineering standards during development: use `$develop-service-code`.
- Implementing or reviewing cross-instance locking, reliable event publication, message consumption, partitioning, dead letters, delayed messages, or related failure handling.: use `$develop-distributed-capabilities`.
- Designing, implementing, or reviewing compensation, reconciliation, repair, cleanup, batch recovery, or fallback workflows: use `$develop-compensation-workflows`.
- Writing, running, or reviewing integration tests in the smoke-test phase: use `$test-integration`.
- Planning or applying coordinated standards-driven layered service refactors: use `$refactor-layered-service`.

## Project documentation entry

- Project documentation entry: `docs/RESPONSIBILITIES.md` — module responsibilities and internal constraints of `framework-starter`; read it before changing any `framework-starter-*` module.
